Haemoglobin A1c level - IFCC standardised Haemoglobin A1c level - IFCC standardised 39 mmol/mol; NICE target in T2DM: 48 mmol/mol, tailored to individual circumstances e.g. quality of life. For adults on a drug associated with hypoglycaemia
aim for a HbA1c level of 53 mmol/mol (NICE, 2015).

FULL LIPID PROFILE
Serum cholesterol level 4.2 mmol/L; For primary prevention refer to a cardiovascular risk calculator if FH unlikely. For statin treated patients refer to Non-HDL Cholesterol.
Serum HDL cholesterol level 1.41 mmol/L [1.2 - 5.0]
Serum triglyceride levels 1.4 mmol/L [0.0 - 1.7]
Serum cholesterol/HDL ratio 3.0
Serum LDL cholesterol level 2.1 mmol/L
Serum non high density lipoprotein cholesterol level 2.8 mmol/L; On statin therapy aim for decrease of greater than
40 % in Non-HDL Cholesterol from baseline (NICE) to an absolute target of &lt; 2.5 mmol/L (JBS3).
