## FULL LIPID PROFILE
Serum cholesterol level 2.5 mmol/L; For primary prevention refer to a cardiovascular risk calculator if FH unlikely. For statin treated patients refer to Non-HDL Cholesterol.
Serum HDL cholesterol level 0.96 mmol/L [1.2 - 5.0]; Below low reference limit
Serum triglyceride levels 1.1 mmol/L [0.0 - 1.7]
Serum cholesterol/HDL ratio 2.6
Serum LDL cholesterol level 1.0 mmol/L
Serum non high density lipoprotein cholesterol level 1.5 mmol/L; On statin therapy aim for decrease of greater than
40 % in Non-HDL Cholesterol from baseline (NICE) to an absolute target of &lt; 2.5 mmol/L (JBS3).
