The isolate was found to be ESBL positive, indicating resistance to amoxycillin and cephalexin, while being sensitive to co-amoxiclav, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam, and amikacin. This result suggests a significant risk of treatment failure with beta-lactam antibiotics due to the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL).", "significance": 8}, {"date": "21 November 2024", "title": "Full Lipid Profile Result", "description": "The full lipid profile indicated a serum HDL cholesterol level of 0.96 mmol/L, which is below the normal reference range of 1.2 - 5.0 mmol/L. Other values included total cholesterol at 2.5 mmol/L, LDL cholesterol at 1.0 mmol/L, and triglycerides at 1.1 mmol/L. The low HDL level raises concerns regarding cardiovascular risk, particularly in patients on statin therapy.", "significance": 7}]}
