{"events": [{"date": "23 August 2021", "title": "Abnormal Serum Cholesterol and Triglyceride Levels", "description": "The patient has a serum cholesterol level of 5.3 mmol/L, which is above the normal range (< 5 mmol/L), and serum triglyceride levels of 3.2 mmol/L, exceeding the normal limit (< 2 mmol/L). These findings indicate potential dyslipidemia, which may increase cardiovascular risk.", "significance": 8}, {"date": "23 August 2021", "title": "Elevated Serum Cholesterol/HDL Ratio", "description": "The serum cholesterol/HDL ratio is recorded at 5.41 mmol/mmol, which is considered elevated. This ratio is a significant marker for cardiovascular risk assessment, indicating a higher likelihood of heart disease.", "significance": 7}, {"date": "23 August 2021", "title": "Low Serum Creatinine Level", "description": "The serum creatinine level is noted at 61 umol/L, which is slightly below the normal range (62 - 106 umol/L). While this may not be clinically significant, it could suggest a need for further renal function evaluation.", "significance": 4}, {"date": "23 August 2021", "title": "Low Serum Sodium Level", "description": "The serum sodium level is recorded at 136 mmol/L, which is at the lower limit of the normal range (136 - 145 mmol/L).
