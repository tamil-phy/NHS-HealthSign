{"events": [{"date": "09 Mar 2024", "title": "Haemoglobin A1c Level", "description": "The latest Haemoglobin A1c level was recorded at 39 mmol/mol, which is below the NICE target of 48 mmol/mol for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). This indicates good glycemic control, especially for adults on medications associated with hypoglycaemia, where the target is 53 mmol/mol. The result suggests effective management of diabetes, but continuous monitoring is essential.", "significance": 5}, {"date": "09 Mar 2024", "title": "Full Lipid Profile", "description": "The Full Lipid Profile indicated an abnormal result with a serum cholesterol level of 4.2 mmol/L, which is within the normal range but requires monitoring for cardiovascular risk. The serum HDL cholesterol level was 1.41 mmol/L, serum triglycerides at 1.4 mmol/L, and serum LDL cholesterol at 2.1 mmol/L. The non-HDL cholesterol level was 2.8 mmol/L, which is above the target of <2.5 mmol/L for patients on statin therapy, indicating a need for potential intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk.", "significance": 7}, {"date": "11 Aug 2023", "title": "Haemoglobin A1c Level", "description": "A previous Haemoglobin A1c level was recorded at 45 mmol/mol, which is also below the NICE target of 48 mmol/mol for T2DM. This result indicates that the patient's diabetes management was effective at that time, but it is important to note that it is still above the optimal target for those on hypoglycaemic medications.", "significance": 4}, {"date": "11 Aug 2023", "title": "Full Blood Count Abnormalities", "description": "The Full Blood Count showed a mean cell haemoglobin level of 25.6 pg, which is below the low reference limit, indicating potential anemia. Additionally, the red blood cell distribution width was recorded at 15.1%, which is above the high reference limit, suggesting variability in red blood cell size that may require further investigation. These findings warrant attention to the patient's hematological status.", "significance": 6}]}
